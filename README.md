A keylogging mechanism is a technique used to record user input events such as keystrokes and peripheral interactions on an endpoint system.
This project demonstrates how endpoint inputs (keyboard, mouse, microphone, screenshot, and webcam) can be monitored in a controlled and ethical environment.
The implementation focuses on cybersecurity awareness and risk demonstration, not malicious usage.
All operations are performed only after explicit user consent.

## Project Objective:

- To demonstrate how keylogging-style endpoint monitoring works at a technical level
- To create awareness about endpoint security risks
- To simulate controlled data collection in a lab environment
- To highlight the importance of user consent, transparency, and ethical boundaries in cybersecurity

## Working of the Project:

- The program starts by requesting explicit user consent via a GUI popup.
- If consent is denied, the program terminates immediately and no monitoring is performed.
- Upon approval, the program records the following endpoint inputs for a limited duration:
              - Keyboard input
              - Mouse movement
              - Microphone audio (time-limited)
              - Single-frame webcam image.

</p>


- All collected data is stored locally in the `logs/` directory.
- A consolidated `activity_report.txt` file is generated summarizing the activities performed.
- An email notification is sent using Mailtrap Sandbox API to safely simulate data exfiltration along with the `activity_report.txt` file as an attachment.
- From a __real attacker’s point of view__, if a real email server or API were configured, the attacker could receive the collected log report as an email attachment, enabling remote access to sensitive endpoint data.
- This project intentionally avoids real email servers and instead uses a sandboxed environment to demonstrate potential risks while maintaining strict ethical boundaries and preventing actual data leakage.
- The user retains full control and can manually delete all collected logs using a command-line option with GUI confirmation.
- __NOTE:__ No monitoring or data transmission occurs without explicit user consent.

## Commands & Execution:

- Run the Monitoring Demonstration

      python main.py


- Displays consent popup
-Executes monitoring only after approval
- Delete All Collected Logs (With Confirmation)
        
      python main.py --delete-logs

     - Opens a confirmation popup
     - Deletes all project-generated log files if approved

- Display Help Information
         
      python main.py --help

     - Shows usage instructions
     - Does not execute monitoring or deletion

## Mailtrap API Token Setup

This project uses **Mailtrap Sandbox API** to safely simulate email-based data exfiltration
without sending real emails to external users.

## Steps to Generate an API Token

1. Create a free account at `https://mailtrap.io` using any valid email address.
2. Switch to **Email Testing / Sandbox**.
3. Open any Inbox.
4. Navigate to **API**.
5. Generate a new **Sandbox API token**.
6. Store the token securely and use it locally only. (do NOT commit it to GitHub)

## Configuration in Code:

- Before running the project, the user must update the following values in main.py:

        MAILTRAP_API_TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE"
        INBOX_ID = YOUR_INBOX_ID
  
- MAILTRAP_API_TOKEN
  - Generated by clicking the API Tokens option in Mailtrap.
  - A pop-up appears allowing the user to generate a new Sandbox API key.

- INBOX_ID
  - The Inbox ID is a numeric value visible in the browser URL when an inbox is opened in the Mailtrap Sandbox environment.

⚠️ **Security Note:**  
- API tokens are sensitive credentials.  
- Never upload real tokens to GitHub or share them publicly.

## Mitigation Steps to Prevent Keylogger Vulnerabilities:

</p>

- Use updated antivirus and endpoint detection tools.
- Restrict application permissions for keyboard, microphone, camera, and screen access.
- Avoid installing untrusted software or browser extensions.
- Monitor running processes and startup applications.
- Enable operating system security features such as application sandboxing.
- Educate users about social engineering and phishing attacks.
  
## Conclusion:

This project provides a practical and ethical demonstration of how keylogging mechanisms function in endpoint systems. By incorporating explicit user consent, transparent operation, and controlled execution, it emphasizes responsible cybersecurity experimentation. The demonstration helps learners understand potential security risks while reinforcing best practices for endpoint protection and user awareness.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer:

- This project is developed strictly for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes.
- It must not be used for unauthorized monitoring, surveillance, or malicious activity.
- All demonstrations are performed in a controlled environment with explicit user consent.
- The author is not responsible for any misuse of this code outside its intended scope.
